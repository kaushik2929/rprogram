mpg

#i. Visualize the distribution of city mpg
# Histogram of City MPG
hist(mpg$cty, main = "Distribution of City MPG", xlab = "City MPG")


 #ii. Show the counts of each car type:
# Bar Plot of Car Types
barplot(table(mpg$class), main = "Counts of Each Car Type", xlab = "Car Type")


#iii. Visualize the relationship between displacement and highway mpg:
# Scatter Plot of Displacement vs. Highway MPG
plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy, main = "Displacement vs. Highway MPG", xlab = "Displacement", ylab="highway MPG"


 #iv. Display the distribution of engine cylinder counts:
# Box Plot of Cylinder Counts
boxplot(mpg$cyl, main = "Distribution of Engine Cylinder Counts", ylab = "Cylinder


#v. Subset the dataset to include cars manufactured by Toyota:
# Subset for Toyota Cars
toyota_cars <- subset(mpg, manufacturer == "toyota")
toyota_cars



#vi. Find cars with a city mpg greater than 20 and highway mpg greater than 30:
# Subset for High Mileage Cars
high_mileage_cars <- subset(mpg, cty > 20 & hwy > 30)
high_mileage_cars



#viii. Calculate the average city mpg for each car class and sort them in descendin
# Average City MPG by Car Class
avg_city_mpg <- aggregate(cty ~ class, data = mpg, FUN = mean)
avg_city_mpg_sorted <- avg_city_mpg[order(avg_city_mpg$cty, decreasing = TRUE), ]
avg_city_mpg_sorted


#ix. Group the data by transmission type and calculate the median engine displaceme
# Median Displacement by Transmission Type
median_displacement <- aggregate(displ ~ trans, data = mpg, FUN = median)
median_displacement



#x. Investigate if there is a trend between model year and city mpg:
# Scatter Plot of Model Year vs. City MPG
plot(mpg$year, mpg$cty, main = "Model Year vs. City MPG", xlab = "Model Year", ylab= "city mpg"


#xi. Detect and list the cars with exceptionally high highway mpg values (potential
# Identify Outliers (e.g., highway mpg > 40)
outliers <- subset(mpg, hwy > 40)
outliers
